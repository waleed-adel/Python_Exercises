This script is responisble for creating a folder with empty (.c and .h) files.
These files are to be filled with device driver codes.
 
  Steps:

		1) First enter name of the driver 
		
		2) Enter 1 or 2 to place the driver folder in the current working directory 
			 or a folder named COTS
		
		3) The user is requested to enter the abstraction layer (MCAL or HAL)
			 Note: MCAL stands for microcontroller abstraction layer
						HAL stands for hardware abstraction layer

		4) It generated 5 files if the driver is in the MCAL
				- name_program.c
				- name_register.h
				- name_interface.h
				- name_congig.h
				- name_private.h
			
			It generated 4 files if the driver is in HAL
				- name_program.c
				- name_interface.h
				- name_congig.h
				- name_private.h
		
		 5) If the driver is in the MCAL it asks you which microcontroller
				folder you want to put it into (for me i have two option: AVR, ARM).
				
Note:
	- All the paths can be modified by the user to suite his needs.
